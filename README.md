# Audit report
The target of this audit is the code repo of [HaloTrade Contracts](https://github.com/halotrade-zone/halotrade-contracts) of the HaloTrade project. The HaloTrade project is an AMM market on Aura network that allows users to trade native and CW20 (a token standard like ERC20) tokens.

The auditing process is iterative. Specifically, [BlockSec](https://www.blocksec.com/) would audit the commits that fix the discovered issues. If there are new issues, they will continue this process. The commit SHA values during the audit are shown in the following table. Their audit report is responsible for the code in the initial version (Version 1), as well as new code (in the following versions) to fix issues in the audit report.
